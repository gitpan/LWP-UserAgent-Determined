NAME

LWP::UserAgent::Determined - a virtual browser that retries errors

SYNOPSIS

  use strict;
  use LWP::UserAgent::Determined;
  my $browser = LWP::UserAgent::Determined->new;
  my $response = $browser->get($url, headers... );

DESCRIPTION

This class works just like LWP::UserAgent (and is based on it, by
being a subclass of it), except that when you use it to get a web page
but run into a possibly-temporary error (like a DNS lookup timeout),
it'll wait a few seconds and retry a few times.

It also adds some methods for controlling exactly what errors are
considered retry-worthy and how many times to wait and for how many
seconds, but normally you needn't bother about these, as the default
settings are relatively sane.




INSTALLATION

You install this module, as you would install any perl module library,
by running these commands:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If you want to install a private copy of this module in your home
directory, then you should try to produce the initial Makefile with
something like this command:

  perl Makefile.PL LIB=~/perl

Then you may need something like
  setenv PERLLIB "$HOME/perl"
in your shell initialization file (e.g., ~/.cshrc).

For further information, see perldoc perlmodinstall


DOCUMENTATION

POD-format documentation is included in this module.  POD is readable
with the 'perldoc' utility.  See ChangeLog for recent changes.
